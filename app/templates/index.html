				<h2>Personal projects</h2>

				<p>My <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a> page is at <a
					href=https://github.com/philippecarphin>https://github.com/philippecarphin</a>.

				<p>There's a lot of stuff on there.  Here is a brief description of
				some of the projects that I have on there.</p>

				<h3><a href=https://github.com/philippecarphin/go_sgf_to_igo_latex>Go
						application</a></h3>
				<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/a/8160532/579594 for proper latex symbol-->
				<p>This application started out as an application to make <span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
				diagrams.  I wanted to save my buddy from doing this tedious work.
				Later I decided to make it into a GUI application.</p>

				<p>I plan to use this code to make a little web application to rotate an
				sgf file for people who played a game that was scribed by their
				opponent.</p>

				<p><a href={{url_for('sgf_turner')}}>This</a> is the work in progres</p>

				<p> More projects to be described soon</p>
