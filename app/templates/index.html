		<h2>Personal projects</h2>

		<p>My <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a> page is at <a
			href=https://github.com/philippecarphin>https://github.com/philippecarphin</a>.

		<p>There's a lot of stuff on there.  Here is a brief description of
		some of the projects that I have on there.</p>

		<h3><a href=https://github.com/philippecarphin/go_sgf_to_igo_latex>Go
				application</a></h3>
		<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/a/8160532/579594 for proper latex symbol-->
		<p>This application started out as an application to make LaTeX
		diagrams.  I wanted to save my buddy from doing this tedious work.
		Later I decided to make it into a GUI application.</p>

		<p>I plan to use this code to make a little web application to rotate an
		sgf file for people who played a game that was scribed by their
		opponent.</p>

		<p> More projects to be described soon</p>
